# Finding the Most Popular Programming Language
For Day 72 of 100 Days of Code, the task is to find the most popular programming language in the world by analyzing the amount of [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) posts tagged with the respective language.

The requirements for trying to use this repository are basically the same as for the GitHub repository [salaries-data-exploration](https://github.com/wrecker-of-code/salaries-data-exploration).

******
## Setup
If you have the requirements installed...

**... clone the repository and cd into it:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wrecker-of-code/popular-languages-pandas.git
cd popular-languages-pandas
```

**... open VsCode:**

```bash
code .
```

***or***

```bash
code Programming_Languages.ipynb
```

This will open either the project folder or just the jupyter notebook file. You will not need to do anything in the `QueryResults.csv` file but have a look into it to know what the pandas dataframe should look like.

***
## Practice
Create a new file and try exploring the data on your own. For that go to the command line and do the following:

```bash
# Creates and opens new Notebook
touch <filename>.ipynb && code <filename>.ipynb
```

***or***

```bash
# Use starting file
code Programming_Languages_start.ipynb
```

Best learning practice is just using the documentation and trying to find out everything on your own. The starting file from [Dr. Angela Yu](https://github.com/angelabauer) contains Markdown cells that contain the challenges to accomplish. Use the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) and [MatplotLib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) documentation to complete the tasks!
***Have fun!***
